# Sarsa and Q-learning

A straightforward application to the temporal-difference policy evaluation
is Sarsa algorithm, which after generating $S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}$
computes
$$q(S_t, A_t) ← q(S_t, A_t) + α\left[R_{t+1} + γ q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) -q(S_t, A_t)\right].$$

~~~
Q-learning was an important early breakthrough in reinforcement learning (Watkins, 1989).

$$q(S_t, A_t) ← q(S_t, A_t) + α\left[R_{t+1} +  γ \max_a q(S_{t+1}, a) -q(S_t, A_t)\right].$$

# Refresh – Off-policy Prediction

Given an initial state $S_t$ and an episode $A_t, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}, …, S_T$,
the probability of this episode under a policy $π$ is
$$∏_{k=t}^{T-1} π(A_k | S_k) p(S_{k+1} | S_k, A_k).$$

~~~
Therefore, the relative probability of a trajectory under the target and
behaviour policies is
$$ρ_t ≝ \frac{∏_{k=t}^{T-1} π(A_k | S_k) p(S_{k+1} | S_k, A_k)}{∏_{k=t}^{T-1} b(A_k | S_k) p(S_{k+1} | S_k, A_k)}
      = ∏_{k=t}^{T-1} \frac{π(A_k | S_k)}{b(A_k | S_k)}.$$

~~~
Therefore, if $G_t$ is a return of episode generated according to $b$, we can
estimate
$$v_π(S_t) = 𝔼_b[ρ_t G_t].$$

# Refresh – Off-policy Monte Carlo Prediction

Let $𝓣(s)$ be a set of times when we visited state $s$. Given episodes sampled
according to $b$, we can estimate
$$v_π(s) = \frac{∑_{t∈𝓣(s)} ρ_t G_t}{|𝓣(s)|}.$$

~~~
Such simple average is called _ordinary importance sampling_. It is unbiased, but
can have very high variance.

~~~
An alternative is _weighted importance sampling_, where we compute weighted
average as
$$v_π(s) = \frac{∑_{t∈𝓣(s)} ρ_t G_t}{∑_{t∈𝓣(s)} ρ_t}.$$

~~~
Weighted importance sampling is biased (with bias asymptotically converging to
zero), but usually has smaller variance.

Comparison of ordinary and weighted importance sampling on Blackjack. Given
a state with sum of player's cards 13 and a usable ace, we estimate target
policy of sticking only with a sum of 20 and 21, using uniform behaviour policy.

# Refresh – Expected Sarsa

The action $A_{t+1}$ is a source of variance, moving only _in expectation_.

~~~
We could improve the algorithm by considering all actions proportionally to their
policy probability, obtaining Expected Sarsa algorithm:
$$\begin{aligned}
  q(S_t, A_t) &← q(S_t, A_t) + α\left[R_{t+1} + γ 𝔼_π q(S_{t+1}, a) - q(S_t, A_t)\right]\\
              &← q(S_t, A_t) + α\left[R_{t+1} + γ ∑\nolimits_a π(a|S_{t+1}) q(S_{t+1}, a) - q(S_t, A_t)\right].
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
Compared to Sarsa, the expectation removes a source of variance and therefore
usually performs better. However, the complexity of the algorithm increases and
becomes dependent on number of actions $|𝓐|$.

~~~
Note that Expected Sarsa is also an off-policy algorithm, allowing the behaviour
policy $b$ and target policy $π$ to differ.

~~~
Especially, if $π$ is a greedy policy with respect to current value function,
Expected Sarsa simplifies to Q-learning.

section: Double Q
# Q-learning and Maximization Bias

Because behaviour policy in Q-learning is $ε$-greedy variant of the target
policy, the same samples (up to $ε$-greedy) determine both the maximizing action
and estimate its value.

# $n$-step Methods

![w=40%,f=right](nstep_td.pdf)

Full return is
$$G_t = ∑_{k=t}^∞ R_{k+1},$$
one-step return is
$$G_{t:t+1} = R_{t+1} + γ V_t(S_{t+1}).$$

~~~
We can generalize both into $n$-step returns:
$$G_{t:t+n} ≝ \left(∑_{k=t}^{t+n-1} γ^{k-t} R_{k+1}\right) + γ^n V_{t+n-1}(S_{t+n}).$$
with $G_{t:t+n} ≝ G_t$ if $t+n ≥ T$.

# $n$-step Methods

A natural update rule is
$$V_{t+n}(S_t) ≝ V_{t+n-1}(S_t) + α\left[G_{t:t+n} - V_{t+n-1}(S_t)\right].$$

# $n$-step Sarsa

Defining the $n$-step return to utilize action-value function as
$$G_{t:t+n} ≝ \left(∑_{k=t}^{t+n-1} γ^{k-t} R_{k+1}\right) + γ^n Q_{t+n-1}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n})$$
with $G_{t:t+n} ≝ G_t$ if $t+n ≥ T$,
~~~
we get the following straightforward
algorithm:
$$Q_{t+n}(S_t, A_t) ≝ Q_{t+n-1}(S_t, A_t) + α\left[G_{t:t+n} - Q_{t+n-1}(S_t, A_t)\right].$$

# Off-policy $n$-step Sarsa

Recall the relative probability of a trajectory under the target and behaviour policies,
which we now generalize as
$$ρ_{t:t+n} ≝ ∏_{k=t}^{\min(t+n, T-1)} \frac{π(A_k | S_k)}{b(A_k | S_k)}.$$

~~~
Then a simple off-policy $n$-step TD can be computed as
$$V_{t+n}(S_t) ≝ V_{t+n-1}(S_t) + αρ_{t:t+n-1}\left[G_{t:t+n} - V_{t+n-1}(S_t)\right].$$

~~~
Similarly, $n$-step Sarsa becomes
$$Q_{t+n}(S_t, A_t) ≝ Q_{t+n-1}(S_t, A_t) + αρ_{t+1:t+n}\left[G_{t:t+n} - Q_{t+n-1}(S_t, A_t)\right].$$

# Off-policy $n$-step Without Importance Sampling

![w=30%,h=center](off_policy_nstep_algorithms.pdf)

Q-learning and Expected Sarsa can learn off-policy without importance sampling.

~~~
To generalize to $n$-step off-policy method, we must compute expectations
over actions in each step of $n$-step update. However, we have not obtained
a return for the non-sampled actions.

~~~
Luckily, we can estimate their values by using the current action-value
function.

# Off-policy $n$-step Without Importance Sampling

![w=10%,f=right](tree_backup_example.pdf)

~~~
We now derive the $n$-step reward, starting from one-step:
$$G_{t:t+1} ≝ R_{t+1} + ∑\nolimits_a π(a|S_{t+1}) Q_{t}(S_{t+1}, a).$$

~~~
For two-step, we get:
$$G_{t:t+2} ≝ R_{t+1} + γ∑\nolimits_{a≠A_{t+1}} π(a|S_{t+1}) Q_{t}(S_{t+1}, a) + γπ(A_{t+1}|S_{t+1})G_{t+1:t+2}.$$

~~~
Therefore, we can generalize to:
$$G_{t:t+n} ≝ R_{t+1} + γ∑\nolimits_{a≠A_{t+1}} π(a|S_{t+1}) Q_{t}(S_{t+1}, a) + γπ(A_{t+1}|S_{t+1})G_{t+1:t+n}.$$
